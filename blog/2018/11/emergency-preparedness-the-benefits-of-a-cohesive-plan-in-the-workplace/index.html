<p>An emergency preparedness plan is an important component for companies of every size and scope. At Servi-Tek, we recognize that creating an emergency preparedness plan at your place of business can yield a multitude of essential, potentially life-saving, benefits including:</p>

<h2 id="promote-employee-safety">Promote Employee Safety</h2>

<p>First and foremost, a well-detailed emergency preparedness plan provides invaluable guidance to keep your employees safe during an unexpected event. A thorough strategy gives your staff a step-by-step outline of what to do, where to go, and who to call to protect everyone in the building as well as prevent injuries or possible fatalities.</p>

<h2 id="minimize-damage-to-facility">Minimize Damage To Facility</h2>

<p>A natural disaster can have significant consequences for your facility, possibly grinding your operations to a halt. Systematically pinpointing any pending risks or threats can help you develop a proactive plan to minimize overall damage to your internal equipment as well as the structure itself.</p>

<h2 id="protect-the-environment">Protect The Environment</h2>

<p>When putting together your plan, you may determine various strategies that not only help you protect your staff and building but also help you reduce any destruction to the environment and surrounding community.</p>

<h2 id="discover-hazardous-work-conditions">Discover Hazardous Work Conditions</h2>

<p>When developing a preparedness plan, you may discover potentially dangerous circumstances within your building that could actually intensify the emergency. Identifying these unsafe or hazardous work conditions provides a vital opportunity to resolve these issues before an act of nature or other unforeseen occurrences.</p>

<h2 id="address-facility-deficiencies-and-inefficiencies">Address Facility Deficiencies And Inefficiencies</h2>

<p>Working through the planning process can also unearth various facility deficiencies and inefficiencies. You and your crew may discover that your building currently lacks vital resources such as supplies, food, and equipment needed to navigate through a natural disaster. Having his information in advance means you can purchase and replenish reserves, rectifying the situation so you’re ready in the event of an emergency.</p>

<h2 id="expedite-resumption-of-business-operations">Expedite Resumption Of Business Operations</h2>

<p>Finally, creating a plan now can help ensure that, in the event of an emergency, your team will have the training, equipment, and personnel to get back to business as usual as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Servi-Tek’s engineering specialists can help you identify building deficiencies, inefficiencies, and potential risks. Contact us today to hear more.</p>
