      <description>Passive solar power is changing the green heating game for companies across multiple industries. Unlike active solar designs that require expensive systems and external energy sources to power pumps, blowers, and equipment, a passive design utilizes already existing energy and leverages features of the building itself to generate heat throughout the structure.

Recent statistics from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that a typical facility wastes, on average, 30% of its overall energy use.
